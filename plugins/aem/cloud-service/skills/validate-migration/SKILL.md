Verify migrated code on a local Cloud SDK without modifying customer code.
Completion requires a saved report AND an accepted outcome submission, not just
a successful build or an emitted payload. Restricted passes retain their caveats.

## Scope and paths

Use `scheduler`, `asset-manager`, `event-migration`, `resource-change-listener`,
`replication`, `legacy-ui`, `custom-templates`, or explicit `cdw`. The dialog patterns are source-only;
they need no SDK or diagnosis. Do not use this skill for dispatcher,
unsupported-runmodes or filevault-deps. Fixes belong to `migration`.

For `custom-templates`, use an isolated local author SDK only. Obtain explicit
approval for an existing disposable test parent beneath `/content/<site>/<test-area>`;
never run this on customer content or a shared SDK. Pass `--content-parent <path>
--allow-content-write true` on BOTH prepare and verify. For one template add
`--template /conf/<site>/settings/wcm/templates/<name>` to prepare (the exact
selection is saved in state). For body-component authoring also pass
`--authoring-container root/<editable-container> --authoring-resource-type <approved-component>`
on verify; otherwise only page-title authoring is tested. Prepare builds and
installs the whole app (the archetype `all` single package via `-pl all -am`, so
unrelated broken modules do not block; a broken *dependency* of the template is a
`build.failed` the developer must fix). A template renders only with its page
component (HTL in `ui.apps`); if that component is absent the run fails naming the
missing component rather than a generic render error. The WCM page-create,
save/reopen, HTML render, and disposable-page cleanup are checked per template.
Sling POST does not prove editor policy enforcement: every such pass is
restricted and must retain that caveat. If cleanup fails, inspect the exact
test page path reported before retrying. No bundle diagnosis is needed for
template-only tasks. Submit and finalize EACH emitted template payload and
receipt separately; a passing sibling never masks a failed template.

Resolve `$VALIDATOR` to the absolute path of `../../validate-migration` relative
to this file. Run commands from the customer's project/module root. For a
single Java class, retain `--pattern <pattern> --fqcn <FQCN> --project <module>`
on prepare and verify. Deployment installs the whole bundle; verification stays
class-scoped. Otherwise prepare auto-diffs `origin/main` (fallback `main`),
including staged, unstaged, and untracked changes.

## Validation boundary

Validate reusable migration contracts and deployment health, not each customer's
business implementation. Built DS descriptors establish service interfaces and
declared properties; MCP establishes bundle/component state. Neither proves
effective overridden properties, callback execution, or business correctness.
Keep `checks.migration_contract` separate from `checks.business_behavior=not_tested`
in saved reports and MCP outcomes. A restricted pass retains all unverified checks.
Old prepared state without built DS contract evidence cannot pass; rerun `prepare`
with the same pattern and class scope before diagnosis and verification.

Do not invoke customer business actions, submit jobs, send email, change content,
shorten schedules, add instrumentation/test endpoints, or modify customer source
to obtain a pass. Existing customer tests may be run separately, unchanged, only
with explicit authorization and a safe test environment; never infer their result.
Before deployment, confirm the selected SDK is safe for automatic activation:
installing a bundle can start scheduled work or listeners. If isolation from
production systems and side effects cannot be established, stop and ask for safe
SDK configuration. Do not change credentials or SDK configuration without approval.

## Workflow

1. **Readiness.** Confirm `diagnose-osgi-bundle` (runtime patterns) and
  `report-migration-outcome` are available before building. Confirm the reporting
   server's CAM URL configuration and intended environment when inspectable;
   tool availability alone does not prove configuration readiness. Never probe
  reporting by sending a fabricated outcome. Load the actual project ID from the
  nearest `migration-runbook.json` (`project.id`), or use an explicit project
  flag. Explicit selection wins. If absent, ask once for the CAM project name;
  never guess or assume a context file is consumed.
    For runtime patterns the SDK is mandatory; never skip deployment or diagnosis
    when discovery fails. Honor a user-provided SDK URL with `--sdk <url>` and
    check it explicitly. Otherwise run
    `node "$VALIDATOR/init.js" --search <workspace>`; it probes 4502/4602/4503
    before searching for a Quickstart JAR.
    A failed workspace search does not mean the SDK is missing. It may be stored
    anywhere locally, outside all open workspace folders. Ask for the absolute
    SDK directory before declaring it missing, then rerun
    `node "$VALIDATOR/init.js" --search "<absolute-sdk-directory>"`, retaining
    `--sdk <url>` if supplied. Select the directory containing the JAR: discovery
    is depth-limited and skips build directories. Do not scan the entire machine.
    Confirm the location before booting an external JAR. Ask for a narrower
    `--search` directory when several JARs exist. Only give download/setup guidance
    after the user confirms no local SDK is available, or the selected SDK fails
    to start. Pin the selected `--sdk <url>` for deployment AND MCP
   diagnosis. Only skip submission when the user explicitly asks for local-only
   validation; state that end-to-end reporting remains incomplete.

2. **Prepare.** Run `node "$VALIDATOR/check.js" --stage prepare` with the selected
   scope/project/SDK flags. It builds, discovers, deploys through the project's
   Maven install profile, and saves `.validate-migration/state.json`. The build
   uses `-DskipTests`; do not claim customer unit tests passed.

3. **Diagnose.** For each emitted BSN, call MCP `diagnose-osgi-bundle` against
   the SAME SDK. Save the exact returned report in
   `.validate-migration/diagnosis-map.json` as `{ "<BSN>": "<raw report>" }`.
  If unavailable, stop recovery and follow the missing-diagnosis path below.
  Never substitute direct Felix calls.

4. **Verify.** Run `node "$VALIDATOR/check.js" --stage verify` with the same scope
  flags. It writes `.validate-migration/<run_id>.{md,json}` and emits one outcome
  payload per task (one per discovered template). A passing validation exits `3` while reporting is pending; this is
   not a code failure. Scheduler properties and Distributor registration are
   restricted when MCP cannot expose them: report exactly what remains unverified,
  including scheduler cluster behavior. Missing diagnosis is `setup.mcp_unavailable`.
  Before treating a runtime failure as final, follow **Bounded runtime recovery**
  below. The skill coordinates recovery; the validator does not poll the SDK.

5. **Submit.** Forward the emitted `report-migration-outcome` payload through MCP
   once on the final verification attempt, including failed validation outcomes.
   Require `ok: true` and a matching `run_id` before saying "outcome recorded".
  Save only the actual response's `ok`, `run_id`, `stored_at`, and `duplicate`
  fields as `.validate-migration/<run_id>-receipt.json`. For failures save
  `{ "ok": false, "error": "<credential-free summary>" }`; never persist raw
  sensitive error text. Never fabricate an acknowledgement. Missing CAM config,
   rejection, or network failure leaves reporting incomplete; do not silently retry.

6. **Finalize.** Run the command below even after submission fails, using the
   saved validation JSON and actual MCP receipt. It updates both reports with
   reporting status, errors, and restrictions. A backend outcome acknowledgement
   confirms acceptance/persistence, NOT separate downstream event delivery; leave
   that unconfirmed unless there is explicit delivery evidence.

```bash
node "$VALIDATOR/check.js" --stage finalize --project <project> \
  --report <project>/.validate-migration/<run_id>.json \
  --receipt <project>/.validate-migration/<run_id>-receipt.json
```

## Bounded runtime recovery

Recovery uses the AEM SDK diagnosis MCP, not outcome-reporting retries. Keep the
same SDK, project/module, pattern, and class filters throughout the original scope.
Unrelated out-of-scope component errors do not fail a scoped validation or trigger
repair unless evidence proves they block a selected class's required dependency.

1. **Activation checks.** For `runtime.bundle_not_active` without a diagnosed code
  blocker, use at most 3 diagnosis checks total per affected BSN per deployment,
  counting the initial check. Between checks, wait 5 seconds, then obtain a
  fresh `diagnose-osgi-bundle` report from the SAME SDK.
  In the map, replace the affected BSN's entry in `diagnosis-map.json` with the
  exact new report, preserve other BSNs, and rerun `--stage verify` with the
  same flags and prepared state. Do not rebuild or redeploy during activation checks.
  Stop waiting as soon as the bundle is Active, or diagnosis identifies a blocker;
  an Active bundle still needs successful component and migration-contract checks.

2. **Analyze and repair.** If activation checks are exhausted, or another runtime
  check fails, inspect MCP bundle/component/log evidence for
  unresolved imports, missing services, or activation exceptions. Permit
  at most one repair cycle for the entire validation invocation, not per class.
  `migration` owns customer source changes: hand it the diagnosis, failed class,
  original scope, and failure evidence. Proceed only with a clear, minimal fix
  within the authorized migration scope. Do not edit source in `validate-migration`,
  guess dependencies, change credentials, broaden scope, or invoke business actions.
  For unclear causes, out-of-scope fixes, or unavailable migration/diagnosis tools,
  stop recovery with the blocker; stop recovery immediately on `setup.mcp_unavailable`.
  If diagnosis becomes unavailable after prepare, remove affected BSN entries
  from the map and rerun verify to produce a final missing-diagnosis outcome;
  never reuse stale evidence. Continue the normal final steps with that outcome.
  If unavailable before prepare, stop with setup guidance without fabricating a run.

3. **Revalidate.** After migration repairs source, recheck deployment safety and
  any affected existing customer tests BEFORE rerunning `--stage prepare` to build
  and deploy the changed artifact through the same Maven profile. A `-DskipTests`
  build is not test evidence. Regenerate diagnosis from this deployment, then rerun verify.
  The new deployment has the same activation-check limit, but no second repair
  cycle. Never verify repaired source using the old artifact or diagnosis.

4. **Keep evidence and finish.** Save credential-free attempt summaries in
  `.validate-migration/recovery.md`: original failure, diagnosis-check counts,
  repair and rationale, each report's run_id, final result, and restrictions.
  Preserve earlier reports; do not overwrite them as though the failure never
  happened. Finish recovery before submission; only the payload and run_id from
  the final verification attempt proceed to Submit and Finalize. Do not submit
  intermediate attempts. If recovery still fails, explain the remaining cause
  and next action rather than starting another loop.

## Completion and failures

Finalization exits `0` for validated and recorded, `1` for failed validation
with reporting recorded, `3` for reporting incomplete; `2` is usage/error.
`--stage all` also exits `3` when runtime diagnosis is still needed.

Close with the target/class count, validation result (including restrictions),
report link, and actual reporting status. Do not claim end-to-end success while
reporting is pending/failed. A local pass and failed submission are distinct.
A no-changes exit is a no-op, not evidence that code was validated.
For failures, explain the root cause and next action briefly; do not dump raw
evidence. A timeout-ending `deploy.failed` allows one deployment retry after
5 seconds. Runtime recovery follows the bounded policy above; never blindly retry
runtime/source contract failures. Source-only failures go back to `migration`
without automatic repair in this runtime recovery loop.

## Guardrails and reference

- Never modify customer source within `validate-migration`, bypass the Maven profile, or send outcomes
  directly to adoption-service. Updating generated reports is allowed.
- Never invent projects, runtime evidence, receipts, or failure classes; use
  [the frozen taxonomy](../../validate-migration/failure-classes.js).
- Only boot workspace SDK JARs or user-confirmed local SDK JARs outside the
  workspace. Never download an SDK or persist credentials in reports, receipts,
  or the user's HOME.
- Read [the validator reference](../../validate-migration/README.md) only for
  configuration, per-pattern contracts, deployment details, or setup guidance.
