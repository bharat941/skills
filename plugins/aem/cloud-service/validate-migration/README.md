# validate-migration

Deploys migrated AEM Cloud Service bundles to a local Cloud SDK and confirms they
actually run — bundle Active, OSGi component Active, Cloud Service contract
properties correct.

Companion to the `migration` skill: `migration` applies the fix,
`validate-migration` proves it works.

> Status: Beta. Verified end-to-end against AEM SDK 2026.8+ with the
> [AEM Quickstart MCP content package](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/ai-in-aem/local-development-with-ai-tools#aem-quickstart-mcp-server).

## Validation and reporting flow

The skill (`plugins/aem/cloud-service/skills/validate-migration/SKILL.md`)
drives the scripts via plugin-relative paths — there is no `npm link` and no
global bin.

```bash
# Per environment — check readiness (mvn/unzip); boots the SDK from the
# workspace if it is not running
node ../../validate-migration/init.js

# Per branch, from your project root:
#   1. build + deploy, list the Bundle-SymbolicNames to diagnose
node ../../validate-migration/check.js --stage prepare

#   2. the coding assistant now calls the AEM Quickstart MCP tool
#      `diagnose-osgi-bundle` for each BSN and writes the raw text outputs to
#      <project>/.validate-migration/diagnosis-map.json as { "<BSN>": "..." }

#   3. consume the diagnosis + emit outcome
node ../../validate-migration/check.js --stage verify

#   4. the assistant submits the emitted payload through report-migration-outcome
#      and saves the actual MCP response to .validate-migration/<run_id>-receipt.json

#   5. persist the acknowledgement or submission error in both local reports
node ../../validate-migration/check.js --stage finalize \
  --report .validate-migration/<run_id>.json \
  --receipt .validate-migration/<run_id>-receipt.json
```

Resolve script paths relative to the skill directory, not the customer's working
directory. Run commands from the selected project/module root or pass
`--project <module>`. For a single Java class, use
`--pattern scheduler --fqcn com.customer.Scheduler --project <bundle-module>`
on prepare and verify. The entire bundle is deployed; only that class is evaluated.
The build uses `-DskipTests`, so this flow does not establish unit-test success.

Auto-diff mode diffs `HEAD` against `origin/main` (fallback `main`),
**including staged, unstaged, and untracked changes** so runs immediately after
the sibling `migration` skill (which edits files without committing) still see
the pending work. Manual override: `--pattern <name>` runs one pattern only.

`--stage all` (the default) stops after prepare with exit `3` when runtime
diagnosis is needed. With an explicit diagnosis map it can run prepare + verify
in one invocation; that does not replace outcome submission and finalization.
Any BSN missing from the map is
reported with `failure_class: setup.mcp_unavailable` and setup guidance; there
is no silent fallback to the Felix Web Console.

## Bounded runtime recovery

The skill, not `check.js` or the outcome-reporting tool, coordinates recovery via
the AEM SDK diagnosis MCP. Keep the original scope and the same project/module,
SDK, pattern, and class filters.
Unrelated out-of-scope component errors do not fail a scoped validation or trigger
repair unless evidence proves they block a selected class's required dependency.

- For `runtime.bundle_not_active` without a diagnosed code blocker, allow at most
  3 diagnosis checks total per affected BSN per deployment, including the initial
  check. Between checks, wait 5 seconds, then obtain a fresh `diagnose-osgi-bundle`
  report and replace the affected entry in `diagnosis-map.json`, preserving other
  BSNs. Rerun verify using saved prepared state. Do not rebuild or redeploy during activation checks.
  Stop waiting when Active or when diagnosis shows a blocker; still verify the
  components and migration contract.
- After exhausted checks or another runtime failure, analyze MCP evidence for
  unresolved imports, missing services, or activation exceptions. Allow
  at most one repair cycle for the entire validation invocation, not per class.
  `migration` owns customer source changes; validation hands it the failed class,
  diagnosis, scope, and evidence, and never edits customer source itself. Only
  clear, minimal fixes within authorized scope qualify. Do not guess dependencies,
  change credentials, broaden scope, or invoke business actions. Stop for unclear
  causes, out-of-scope fixes, or unavailable tools; stop recovery immediately on `setup.mcp_unavailable`.
  If diagnosis becomes unavailable after prepare, remove affected BSN entries
  from the map and rerun verify to produce a final missing-diagnosis outcome,
  then continue the normal final steps. Do not reuse stale diagnosis. If unavailable
  before prepare, stop with setup guidance without fabricating a run.
- After a repair, recheck deployment safety and affected existing customer tests,
  then run prepare again through the same Maven profile, obtain new diagnosis,
  and verify again. The new deployment retains the activation-check limit but
  permits no second repair cycle. Never reuse the old artifact or diagnosis.
- Preserve credential-free attempt summaries in `.validate-migration/recovery.md`
  with the original failure, counts, repair rationale, report run_ids, final result,
  and restrictions. Preserve intermediate reports without submitting them; only
  the payload and run_id from the final verification attempt proceed to submission
  and finalization. Unresolved failures stop with the remaining cause and next action.

For a timeout-ending `deploy.failed`, permit one deployment retry after 5 seconds.
Do not blindly retry runtime/source contract failures. Source-only failures return
to migration without automatic repair in this runtime recovery loop.

## Completion contract

Verify always writes `.validate-migration/<run_id>.md` and `.json`. Validation
and reporting are separate: a restricted local pass is not end-to-end completion.
Passing verification exits `3` while awaiting reporting; failed validation exits
`1` but its outcome must still be submitted.

Before building, confirm the diagnosis/reporting tools are configured and check
the reporting server's `cam.apiBaseUrl` and selected environment when accessible.
Availability of the MCP tool alone does not establish configuration readiness.
Never test reporting with a fabricated payload. Load `project.id` (and optional
`project.name`) from the nearest `migration-runbook.json`, or use an explicit
flag, which takes precedence. If none is linked, ask for the actual CAM project
name. Context files are not consumed. Only skip submission for an explicit local-only
request, and do not label reporting complete.

Forward the emitted payload once to `report-migration-outcome`, then save its
actual `ok`, `run_id`, `stored_at`, and `duplicate` fields as the receipt. Wrap
errors as `{ "ok": false, "error": "<credential-free summary>" }`, not raw
potentially sensitive text. Never put credentials in receipts. Finalization
keeps a safe error summary rather than copying arbitrary error text to reports.
Finalization requires `ok: true` and the SAME `run_id`; it does not make a network
request or resubmit the outcome. It persists reporting status, errors, and
restricted-check explanations in the reports. Exit codes:

| Stage/result | Exit |
|---|---|
| Finalize: validation passed and outcome recorded | `0` |
| Validation failed (including after acknowledged reporting) | `1` |
| Usage or malformed input | `2` |
| Diagnosis or reporting incomplete | `3` |

An acknowledged outcome means the backend accepted/persisted it. It is not proof
of a separate downstream event being delivered; the report leaves event delivery
unconfirmed. A failed submission does not turn a local validation pass into a
code failure, and must not be silently retried or presented as recorded.

## Prerequisites

- AEM Cloud SDK: mandatory for runtime patterns. Reuse a running SDK on
  4502 / 4602 / 4503, or explicitly check the user's URL with `--sdk <url>`.
  An `aem-sdk-quickstart*.jar` may be stored anywhere locally, not just in the
  workspace. If workspace discovery fails, ask for its absolute directory
  before declaring the SDK missing. Pass that user-confirmed directory with
  `--search "<absolute-sdk-directory>"` to `init.js` / `check.js`; retain
  `--sdk <url>` if supplied. These scripts boot the selected JAR if needed.
  Search the directory containing the JAR, not the whole machine: discovery
  descends at most four directory levels and skips `node_modules`, `.git`,
  `target`, `dist`, and `build`. If several JARs match, narrow `--search`.
  Only offer [SDK download guidance](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/aemcloud.html)
  after the user confirms no local SDK exists, or provide setup guidance if
  the selected SDK fails to start. Never skip runtime validation.
- [AEM Quickstart MCP server](https://github.com/adobe/cq-quickstart-mcp-server/)
  configured in the coding assistant. See the
  [Adobe setup docs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/ai-in-aem/local-development-with-ai-tools#aem-quickstart-mcp-server).
- `mvn` and `unzip` on `PATH`.
- Node 18+.

## Config

Zero config for standard local dev. Overrides via env or CLI:

| Env | CLI | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AEM_SDK_URL` | `--sdk <url>` | auto-discover on 4502 / 4602 / 4503 | first SDK to answer wins |
| - | `--search <dir>` | current working directory | absolute SDK directory anywhere locally; confirm external JAR location before booting |
| `AEM_SDK_USER` | `--user <name>` | `admin` | refused on non-localhost URLs |
| `AEM_SDK_PASS` | `--password <pw>` | `admin` | refused on non-localhost URLs |
| — | `--project-id <id>` | auto-loaded from nearest `migration-runbook.json` | explicit selection overrides inherited identity |
| — | `--project-name <name>` | user-confirmed CAM project name | reporting MCP resolves the name; payload can be emitted without an ID |
| — | `--diagnosis-map <file>` | `<project>/.validate-migration/diagnosis-map.json` | agent-supplied BSN → raw MCP text output |
| — | `--fqcn <class>` | inferred | pin the Java class for patterns that support it, including scheduler |
| — | `--stage prepare\|verify\|all\|finalize` | `all` | validation and acknowledged-report finalization |
| — | `--report <json>` | required for finalize | saved validation record |
| — | `--receipt <json>` | required for finalize | actual reporting MCP response |

No global validator configuration or credentials are persisted to `$HOME`.
No `~/.validate-migration/*`; SDK boot logs stay next to the selected JAR.

## Deploy strategy

Prefers the customer project's `-PautoInstallBundle` (or `-PautoInstallPackage`)
Maven profile — the AEM archetype standard, which uses whatever install plugin
the project itself configures. Auto-falls-back to
`sling-maven-plugin:install-file` if the profile install fails (e.g. WKND legacy
pins `maven-sling-plugin:2.1.0` with a WebDAV config that returns 409). Both
attempts are captured in the outcome log so the reviewer sees exactly what ran.

## Runtime verification via MCP

Bundle + component state come from the coding-assistant's own MCP session with
the [AEM Quickstart MCP server](https://github.com/adobe/cq-quickstart-mcp-server)
(`diagnose-osgi-bundle` tool). **This script does not speak MCP** — it consumes
a JSON map of `{ "<BSN>": "<raw tool text output>" }` written to
`.validate-migration/diagnosis-map.json` by the coding assistant between
`--stage prepare` and `--stage verify`.

Signals the MCP tool does not expose today (component DS properties like
`scheduler.expression`, `scheduler.runOn`, `job.topics` on the running
component; `Distributor` service registration) are reported as
`restricted: true` on an otherwise-passing outcome and tracked as upstream
feature requests against
[`apache/sling-org-apache-sling-mcp-server-contributions`](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-mcp-server-contributions).
There is no fallback to direct Felix Web Console access.

## Pattern contracts

| Pattern | Verification | Unverified signals |
|---|---|---|
| `scheduler` | Built Runnable service, scalar nonempty expression, scalar SINGLE/LEADER runOn, scalar Boolean concurrency if declared; Active bundle/component via MCP | effective properties, cron interpretation, scheduled execution, and cluster behavior |
| `asset-manager` | Active bundle/component; offline absence of AssetManager references | customer asset operations and business effects |
| `event-migration` | Built JobConsumer service and nonempty String `job.topics`; Active bundle/component | effective properties, job processing, and business effects |
| `resource-change-listener` | Built listener service, nonempty String paths and supported change types; Active bundle/component | effective properties, listener callbacks, and business effects |
| `replication` | Active bundle; distribution import, no CQ replication import | Distributor service registration, distribution execution, and business effects |
| `legacy-ui` | Source-only dialog inspection for Classic UI and Coral 2 | runtime rendering and interactions |
| `cdw` | Source-only inspection for classic widget types and custom xtypes | runtime rendering and interactions |

### Validation boundary

These are reusable migration-contract checks, not customer-specific business tests.
DS checks inspect the built descriptor, including scalar and multiline properties;
they do not establish effective SDK configuration. Invalid supported source contracts
fail with `source.contract_mismatch` before runtime diagnosis. Reports and MCP class
entries separate `checks.migration_contract` (`pass`, `fail`, or `not_verified`) from
`checks.business_behavior=not_tested`. A pass is limited to the supported contract;
restrictions and reporting status remain separate. It is not a claim of business
correctness or cluster behavior.
Older prepared state without built DS contract evidence is not verified and cannot
pass; rerun `--stage prepare` with the same pattern and class scope. An external
listener marker does not replace registration under `ResourceChangeListener`.

Do not invoke customer business actions, send email, submit jobs, mutate customer
content, change schedules, or add test endpoints/instrumentation. The only exception
is an explicitly approved disposable page under a dedicated test parent for
`custom-templates`; cleanup is mandatory. Do not modify
customer source. Existing customer tests can be run separately and unchanged only
with explicit authorization and a safe test setup; this validator does not run them.
Before deployment, confirm the SDK is isolated from production side effects because
bundle activation can itself start customer work. If safety cannot be established,
stop for safe SDK configuration; configuration changes require approval.

`cdw` must be selected explicitly; auto-diff classifies shared dialog paths as
`legacy-ui`. Dispatcher, unsupported-runmodes, and filevault-deps
are not wired into this validator. Source-only patterns do not touch the SDK.
`custom-templates` builds and installs the whole app (the archetype `all` single
package via `-pl all -am`) on an isolated local SDK, then creates, authors,
renders and deletes a page per editable template. Unrelated broken modules do
not block; a broken dependency of the template is a `build.failed`. A missing
page component (ui.apps not deployed) fails naming the component.
Pass `--content-parent /content/<site>/<test-area> --allow-content-write true`
on prepare and verify, and optionally `--template /conf/<site>/settings/wcm/templates/<name>`
on prepare to narrow selection. Body authoring requires both
`--authoring-container root/<editable-container>` and
`--authoring-resource-type <approved-component>` on verify. A pass remains
restricted: Sling POST does not establish AEM editor-policy enforcement. Each
template gets its own payload, report, receipt and finalize invocation.

## Files that ship with this plugin

- `init.js` — local readiness check; boots a workspace SDK if none is running (does NOT speak MCP).
- `sdk.js` — shared SDK detect / search / boot logic used by `init.js` and `check.js`.
- `check.js` — prepare = build/discover/deploy; verify = consume diagnosis and
  emit outcome; finalize = persist the reporting acknowledgement or error.
- `plan.js` — branch-diff scoping. Includes committed, staged, unstaged, and
  untracked changes.
- `build.js`, `deploy.js` — reusable helpers.
- `template-runtime.js` — isolated, disposable WCM template page probe.
- `failure-classes.js` — frozen failure taxonomy shared with the MCP tool and
